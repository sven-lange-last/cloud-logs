# IBM Cloud Logs

[IBM Cloud Logs](https://www.ibm.com/products/cloud-logs) is a service in the IBM Cloud that allows you to store, query, and analyse your logs including [audit events](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/atracker?topic=atracker-cloud_services_atracker) and [platform logs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/logs-router?topic=logs-router-cloud_services) created by IBM Cloud services or the IBM Cloud platform.

In this repository, I share experiments that I have conducted with IBM Cloud Logs to help others use the service successfully. I work for IBM. However, the texts shared here are not official statements about the capabilities of IBM Cloud Logs.
